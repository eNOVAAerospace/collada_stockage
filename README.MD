# DAE Solution Storage



# How to: Add a file

To add a Collada file (```.dae``` extension file), firstly create a directory with the name of the file.

For example the ``Unit_Sphere.dae`` will be stored in the ``Unit_Sphere/`` directory.

All the textures and files concerning the collada file will be then stored in the same directory path, and will ease its use.

# How to: Use a file in Google Earth Pro or another

To consult and use the file, you should click on the folder you're interested in.
For this case it will be the ``Unit_Sphere/`` folder.
